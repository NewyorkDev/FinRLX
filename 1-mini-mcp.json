KEY FINDINGS: (1) TERTIARY's success attributed to better entry timing (10-100+ min earlier), more strategic position sizing (31 trades vs 27-29), earlier profit-taking (12:24 avg sell vs 11:54), and peak activity during optimal 10:00 hour, (2) All accounts completely missed top gainers BULLZ (+53.19%), NKTR (+29.12%), INSM (+28.65%), BGM (+23.75%), MTSR (+15.50%) representing major opportunity cost, (3) Timing differences of 6+ hours between same stock executions across accounts created unnecessary arbitrage, (4) Position sizing more critical than stock selection - accounts traded same instruments but different outcomes due to execution timing and sizing discipline. ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS: Add momentum screener for >10% daily gainers, synchronize account execution to <5 min spread, implement TERTIARY's disciplined exit strategy system-wide, focus activity on optimal 10:00-11:00 market hours.
