 10-Day System Evaluation Challenge

Objective:
Evaluate the trading system over a 10-day period using a letter grade system (A–F) based on core performance criteria.

Grading Criteria:
Each day is evaluated and graded. A failing day is one where:
	•	The system crashes or doesn’t run at all.
	•	Major failures or inconsistencies are observed.

⸻

🧾 Daily Evaluation Categories:

⸻

✅ 1. Consistency and Reliability
	•	No stale or outdated data.
	•	No careless mistakes (e.g., moved config files, using wrong file versions).
	•	All automation runs without manual patches or ad hoc scripts.
	•	Expectation: System should self-correct or handle retries without human intervention.

⸻

❌ 2. Core Functionality Failure
	•	If the system fails to liquidate positions or doesn’t perform intended trades.
	•	Missed sell triggers, broken logic, or order flow failure.
	•	Expectation: System executes trades according to logic without missing steps.

⸻

🧪 3. Misleading Statements / False Confidence
	•	Claiming system is airtight or complete when nightly fixes are still needed.
	•	Saying “everything’s working” when important modules are not stable.
	•	Expectation: Transparency. If something is broken, it’s acknowledged and tracked.

⸻

🔍 4. Missing Core Dependencies / Fallback Reliance
	•	Issues like missing non-B modules, incorrect installations, or PATH misconfigurations.
	•	System relying on fallback logic instead of main modules.
	•	Expectation: Main path should succeed without relying on backups.

⸻

🗃️ 5. Supabase Integration
	•	Data must be written to Supabase as the centralized database.
	•	Wrong table references, missing writes, or incomplete data pipelines are failures.
	•	Expectation: All events are logged and traceable in Supabase.

⸻

🔄 6. Code Versioning and Updates
	•	System must use newest working version.
	•	Old/incomplete scripts should be archived or deprecated.
	•	No regression due to reintroducing outdated modules.
	•	Expectation: Active version control and proper phasing out of old code.

⸻

📉 7. Trading Performance
	•	System avoids trading or makes poor trades consistently.
	•	No trade = lost opportunity.
	•	Trades that violate expected logic = system fault.
	•	Expectation: Capture high-potential trades based on identified logic.

⸻

❗ Final Rule:

If the basics aren’t working, then the system is considered a failure overall.
